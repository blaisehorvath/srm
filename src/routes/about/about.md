## Introduction

We’re a software development team focusing on web and embedded electronics
development or Internet Of Things to put it simply. Coming from very different
backgrounds, together we have experience in wide range of subjects.
Balázs studied Molecular Biology at ELTE in Budapest and went into systems and
computational biology research. Viktor, the other member is a physics student
who switched to electrical engineering, with a lot of side projects including
FPGAs and CNC machines amongst others. One thing is true for both of us: we’ve
been turned to programming at a very young age.

## Technologies

For web development our main
technologies are: Node.js, React, Redux and Amazon AWS. For embedded systems we’re
 mainly using TI/ST ARM microcontrollers and Contiki os. We both believe in
 open technologies, our solutions are usually built on them whenever possible.

## Why us?

As a team we are able to design a complete IOT solution from electrical design,
 prototyping, mechanical design, web development and deployment.
