  <p>
    As a team, weâ€™re able to develop a complete IOT solution. We also know how to deploy embedded operating systems such
    as <a href="https://www.riot-os.org/">RIOT</a> and <a href="http://www.contiki-os.org/">Contiki</a> on various hardware.
        We have experience with RIOT and Contiki OS, and we are quite familiar with their networking stack, driver system and
        application level programming API.
        We have built a Web Application that can communicate with devices connected to a IPv6 based RF network.
