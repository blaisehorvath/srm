Located in Budapest, we’re working together as freelancers to make money and opportunities for projects we love ( don’t get me wrong, we love web development ;) ). The thing which got us together is an interest in using technology as a tool to achieve sustainable and happy life. This mostly means making your own food using aquaponics amongst other things, in which we’re planning to get seriously into.

Our personalities are very different, but in a way that they complement each other, allowing us to make better things than one of us could make alone, and we both strongly believe that this will be the key to our future success.
